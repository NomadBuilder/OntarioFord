# Layout Analysis & Recommendations

## Current Flow (18 Sections)

1. **Cold Open** - "This is how it's supposed to work"
2. **Numbers** - Key stats, growth percentages
3. **Before/After** - 2018 vs 2024 comparison ⚠️ REDUNDANT with #2
4. **Policy Timeline** - Policy events and consequences
5. **Ledger Enhanced** - Main interactive visualization
6. **Staffing Crisis** - $9.2B staffing agencies deep dive
7. **Cost Comparison** - 3x cost multiplier
8. **Hospital Crisis** - 66/134 hospitals, OECD ranking
9. **Long-Term Care** - LTC bed allocations
10. **Ford Tracker** - Broader pattern (cuts + privatization (Americanization)) ⚠️ OVERLAPS with #4
11. **Vendor Callouts** - Specific vendor examples
12. **Regional Impact** - Geographic disparities
13. **Impact Summary** - Impact recap (6 cards) ⚠️ REDUNDANT with #14
14. **Key Findings** - 6 numbered findings ⚠️ REDUNDANT with #13
15. **Data Integrity** - Data credibility ⚠️ BREAKS NARRATIVE FLOW
16. **Naming** - Declarative statements ⚠️ FEELS DISCONNECTED
17. **Lenses** - Interactive filters
18. **Loss** - Emotional peak + CTA

## Issues Identified

### 1. Redundancy
- **Sections 2 & 3**: Both show numbers/comparison (Numbers vs Before/After)
- **Sections 13 & 14**: Both are summaries (Impact Summary vs Key Findings)
- **Sections 4 & 10**: Both cover policy/pattern (Policy Timeline vs Ford Tracker)

### 2. Narrative Flow Problems
- **Section 15 (Data Integrity)**: Technical credibility section breaks emotional narrative
- **Section 16 (Naming)**: Declarative statements feel disconnected from data-heavy sections
- Too many sections (18) may overwhelm users

### 3. Grouping Issues
- Deep dives (6-9) are scattered
- Summaries (13-14) come too late
- Interactive elements (5, 17) are separated

## Recommended Reorganization

### Option A: Streamlined (12-13 sections)

**ACT 1: The Setup**
1. Cold Open
2. Numbers (merge Before/After into this)
3. Policy Timeline (merge Ford Tracker pattern into this)

**ACT 2: The Evidence**
4. Ledger Enhanced (main visualization)
5. Staffing Crisis
6. Cost Comparison
7. Hospital Crisis
8. Long-Term Care
9. Vendor Callouts
10. Regional Impact

**ACT 3: The Conclusion**
11. Key Findings (merge Impact Summary into this)
12. Naming (move earlier, before Lenses)
13. Lenses (interactive exploration)
14. Loss (CTA)

**Technical/Credibility**: Move Data Integrity to Methodology drawer

### Option B: Grouped by Theme (14 sections)

**PART 1: The Numbers**
1. Cold Open
2. Numbers
3. Before/After
4. Policy Timeline

**PART 2: The Deep Dives**
5. Ledger Enhanced
6. Staffing Crisis
7. Cost Comparison
8. Hospital Crisis
9. Long-Term Care

**PART 3: The Pattern**
10. Ford Tracker
11. Vendor Callouts
12. Regional Impact

**PART 4: The Takeaway**
13. Key Findings (merge Impact Summary)
14. Naming
15. Lenses
16. Loss

**Technical**: Data Integrity → Methodology

## Recommended Changes

1. **Merge Before/After into Numbers** - They're too similar
2. **Merge Impact Summary into Key Findings** - One summary is enough
3. **Move Data Integrity to Methodology drawer** - Technical info shouldn't break narrative
4. **Move Naming earlier** - Before interactive sections, after data
5. **Consider merging Policy Timeline and Ford Tracker** - Or make Ford Tracker more distinct

## Proposed Final Order (Option A - Streamlined)

1. Cold Open
2. Numbers (includes before/after comparison)
3. Policy Timeline (includes broader pattern)
4. Ledger Enhanced
5. Staffing Crisis
6. Cost Comparison
7. Hospital Crisis
8. Long-Term Care
9. Vendor Callouts
10. Regional Impact
11. Key Findings (includes impact summary)
12. Naming
13. Lenses
14. Loss

**Total: 14 sections** (down from 18)
