# Enhancement Proposals for The Ledger

Based on CCPA report "Hollowed Out" and other resources, here are powerful additions to make the tool more robust and impactful.

## 🎯 High-Impact Additions

### 1. **Policy Timeline Section** (NEW)
**Purpose**: Connect spending spikes to specific Ford government policies

**Content**:
- **2018**: Doug Ford takes office
- **2019**: Bill 124 passed (wage suppression - 1% cap)
- **2020**: Pandemic begins, private agency spending explodes
- **2022**: Bill 124 ruled unconstitutional
- **2023**: Hospitals face massive deficits (66 of 134)

**Visual**: Annotated timeline with spending spikes aligned to policy decisions

**Impact**: Shows this isn't accidental - it's policy-driven

---

### 2. **Cost Comparison Section** (NEW)
**Purpose**: Show the true cost of privatization (Americanization)

**Key Stats from CCPA Report**:
- Private agency staff cost **3x more** than regular employees
- Private agencies account for **0.4% of hours** but **6% of costs** ($725M in 2022-23)
- In North West region: **17% of staffing costs** go to private agencies

**Visual**: Side-by-side comparison
- "What $725M could fund instead"
- "3x the cost for the same work"
- Regional breakdown showing which areas are most affected

**Impact**: Makes the waste tangible

---

### 3. **Hospital Crisis Context** (NEW)
**Purpose**: Show the consequences of underfunding

**Key Stats**:
- **66 of 134 hospitals** (49%) had deficits in 2023-24
- **63% of small hospitals** (<$100M revenue) in deficit
- Ontario ranked **33/38 OECD countries** in hospital beds per capita

**Impact**: Shows the human cost, not just numbers

---

### 4. **Staffing Agency Deep Dive** (ENHANCE EXISTING)
**Purpose**: Focus on the biggest privatization (Americanization) story

**From CCPA Report**:
- **$9.2 billion** paid to private agencies over 10 years (2013-2023)
- Real per capita private agency costs **nearly doubled (98%)** while public staff spending grew only **6%**
- North West region: **480% increase** in agency costs
- North Simcoe Muskoka: **372% increase**

**Visual Enhancement**:
- Dedicated section showing staffing agency growth
- Regional heat map

### 5. **Regional Impact Section** (NEW)
**Purpose**: Show which communities are hit hardest

**Key Findings**:
- **Fastest-growing, most-racialized communities** have lowest per capita hospital spending:
  - Central West (Brampton, Etobicoke, northern Peel)
  - Central (Markham, Vaughan, North York)
  - Central East (Durham, Peterborough, Scarborough)
- **Northern regions** hit hardest by agency costs:
  - North West: 17% of staffing costs to agencies
  - North East: 11% of staffing costs to agencies

**Visual**: 
- Interactive map of Ontario
- Hover to see regional stats
- Color-coded by impact level

**Impact**: Makes it personal and local

- Cards showing vendor, first appearance, total payments
- "These companies didn't exist in Ontario's public accounts before 2018"

**Impact**: Makes it real, not abstract

---

### 8. **The Vicious Cycle Diagram** (NEW)
**Purpose**: Explain how privatization (Americanization) creates its own demand

**Cycle**:
1. Government underfunds hospitals
2. Hospitals can't retain staff (Bill 124 wage suppression)
3. Staff leave for better pay/conditions
4. Hospitals forced to use expensive private agencies
5. Agency costs consume budget
6. Less money for public staff
7. More staff leave
8. **Repeat**

**Visual**: Animated circular diagram that users can step through

**Impact**: Shows this is systemic, not accidental

---

### 9. **Capacity Crisis Metrics** (NEW)
**Purpose**: Show Ontario's hospital system is failing

**Key Stats**:
- Ontario: **33/38 OECD countries** in hospital beds per capita
- **Second-fewest** beds per capita in Canada
- **Hallway medicine is the norm**
- Real per capita hospital spending: **4% increase 2013-2022** (most in 2022 with federal pandemic funds)
- **Seven years of real per capita cuts** over the decade

**Visual**: 
- Comparison charts: Ontario vs other provinces, vs OECD
- "This is what underfunding looks like"

**Impact**: Puts Ontario's crisis in global context
