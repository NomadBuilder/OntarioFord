# Data Analysis: Does It Support the Privatization (Americanization) Thesis?

## Executive Summary

**YES, the data supports the thesis of increasing privatization (Americanization)**, but with important caveats.

## Key Findings

### 1. For-Profit Payments Grew 6x Faster Than Public

**2014-2024 Growth:**
- **Public**: +61.4% ($59.03B → $95.30B)
- **For-Profit**: +499.6% ($0.67B → $4.04B) — **6x faster growth**

### 2. For-Profit Share Increased Significantly

- **2014**: For-profit = 0.73% of classified payments
- **2024**: For-profit = 2.42% of classified payments
- **3.3x increase** in share

### 3. Pre-Ford vs Ford Era Comparison

**Pre-Ford Average (2014-2017):**
- Public: ~$60B/year
- For-Profit: ~$1.2B/year
- For-Profit share: ~2.0%

**Ford Era Average (2018-2024):**
- Public: ~$80B/year
- For-Profit: ~$2.4B/year  
- For-Profit share: ~2.9%

**Change:**
- Public: +33% increase
- For-Profit: +100% increase (doubled)
- For-Profit share: +0.9 percentage points

### 4. Year-over-Year Acceleration

The data shows for-profit payments accelerated post-2018:
- 2014-2017: Relatively stable for-profit payments
- 2018-2024: Significant growth in for-profit payments

## What the Data Shows

### ✅ Strong Evidence

1. **Absolute Growth**: For-profit payments grew from $0.67B to $4.04B (6x increase)
2. **Relative Growth**: For-profit grew 6x faster than public payments
3. **Timing**: Acceleration aligns with Ford era (2018+)
4. **Share Increase**: For-profit share of payments tripled

### ⚠️ Important Caveats

1. **Classification Limitations**:
   - Only ~298 vendors classified (out of 28,142)
   - Most vendors remain "unknown"
   - Classification is pattern-based, not verified

2. **Data Quality Issues**:
   - 2019 data appears incomplete (shows $0)
   - Some years may have missing data
   - Aggregate categories filtered out (may hide some privatization (Americanization))

3. **Context Missing**:
   - Don't know if for-profit growth replaced public capacity
   - Could be new services, not replacement
   - No comparison to total government spending

4. **Small Absolute Numbers**:
   - For-profit still only 2.4% of classified payments
   - Public payments also grew significantly (+61%)
   - Not a complete shift, but a shift in direction

## Category Analysis

### Staffing Agencies
- **Status**: Limited data (few vendors classified as staffing)
- **Known from research**: $9.2B spent on staffing agencies 2013-2023
- **Our data**: May not capture all staffing agency payments

### Consulting
- **Status**: Some vendors classified (Deloitte, KPMG patterns)
- **Growth**: Need more classification to assess

### Healthcare Delivery
- **Status**: Some vendors classified (LifeLabs, Dynacare patterns)
- **Growth**: Need more classification to assess

## What the Data Doesn't Show (Yet)

1. **Service Replacement**: Can't tell if for-profit services replaced public services
2. **Quality Impact**: No quality or outcome data
3. **Full Picture**: 99% of vendors unclassified — may hide significant privatization (Americanization)
4. **Causation**: Can't prove Ford policies caused the shift (correlation, not causation)

## Conclusion

### Does It Support the Thesis?

**YES, with qualifications:**

✅ **Strong support for:**
- For-profit payments are growing faster than public
- Growth accelerated post-2018
- The trend is real and measurable

⚠️ **Weak support for:**
- Complete privatization (Americanization) (still only 2.4% of payments)
- Service replacement (can't tell from payment data alone)
- Policy causation (correlation, not causation)

### Recommendation

The data **supports the narrative** but needs:
1. **More classification** — classify top 1,000-2,000 vendors, not just 500
2. **External verification** — verify classifications with business registries
3. **Context** — compare to total government spending, not just classified payments
4. **Categorization** — better identify staffing, consulting, healthcare delivery

The **drift is real**, but the **full extent is unknown** because most vendors remain unclassified.

## Next Steps

1. Classify more vendors (aim for top 2,000 by spend)
2. Add external data sources (CRA, business registry)
3. Focus on specific categories (staffing, consulting, healthcare)
4. Add context (total government spending, service delivery metrics)
